## Predicting Automobile Safety

This repository contains all documents that lead to a project to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the severity of an automobile crash based on known information about vehicle and driver characteristics. The dataset explored in this project is the "Synthetic Indian Automobile Crash Data"^[This dataset was sourced from Swayam Patil's "Synthetic Indian Automobile Crash Data" dataset on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swish9/synthetic-indian-automobile-crash-data).] dataset.
